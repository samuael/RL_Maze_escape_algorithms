### Reinforcement Learning Methods for the Maze Game

##### Solving the problem using DQN, DDQN, DDQN, and Policy gradient

The table below gives an impression of the relative performance of each of these models :

| Model | Trained | Average no of episodes | Average training time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| DQN | 10 times | 9700 | 504.623 sec |
| DDQN  | 10 times | 12700 | 357.61 sec |
|SARSA  | 10 times |   300    |   43.31 sec         |
|Policy grandient| 10 times|     |          |
