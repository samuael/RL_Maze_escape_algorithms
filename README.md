### Escape from a maze using reinforcement learning

##### Solving an optimization problem using an MDP and TD learning

The table below gives an impression of the relative performance of each of these models (on my PC):

| Model | Trained | Average no of episodes | Average training time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| SARSA | 10 times | 149.5 | 16.5 sec |
| DDQN  | 10 times | 87.0 | 5.2 sec |

Requires matplotlib, numpy, keras and tensorflow.
