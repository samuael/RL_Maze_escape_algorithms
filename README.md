### Escape from a maze using reinforcement learning

##### Solving an optimization problem using an MDP and TD learning

The table below gives an impression of the relative performance of each of these models (on my PC):

| Model | Trained | Average no of episodes | Average training time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| DQN | 10 times | 9700 | 504.623 sec |
| DDQN  | 10 times | 12700 | 357.61 sec |
|SARSA  | 10 times |       |            |

Requires Matplotlib, NumPy, and Jax.
